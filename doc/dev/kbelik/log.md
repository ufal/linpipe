# Log of KBELik Progress

### Mar 6, 2023
- Discussing posible implementations of the QID and string persistent indices,
  and the distribution of QIDs.

  - MS: I think the development should happen in a separate branch. However,
    it will be regularly merged with the `master` branch (maybe on the meetings?
    regularly through pull requests?). The commits to this log can go directly
    to the `master` branch.
